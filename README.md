# Python scripts

I'm not familiar with Python.

Also I need small scripts.

Why not write them in Python then?

## Scripts

`/monitoring/monitoring-urls.py`: script used by a cron to check URLs and send email in case of non 200 response.

`/monitoring/monitoring-nginx-access-logs.py`: script used by a cron to generate an HTML tab counting failing requests by IP address and response code
